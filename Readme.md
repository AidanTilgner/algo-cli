# Algo CLI

## A CLI written in Golang which exists to make studying for algo and data structure problems easy

This is basically a project that I'm working on in order to both study for coding interviews myself, as well as hopefully help someone in the future.

## Features

- Select a problem that you are working on, you then get options on what you want to do with that problem:
- Hint mode, it will give you a couple of hints when you ask for them, they will only be available on a set time though, so you can't just have all of them
- Time mode, it will give you some countdowns or timers to let you know how much time you have, or don't have
- Answer mode, explains the answer in a way that is simple to understand so that you can try again
- Question mode, where the user will be given a question to answer
